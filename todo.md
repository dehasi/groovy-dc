This project needs full refactoring.
But the first prepatatiob steps should be done.

- [x] [GDC-03](https://github.com/dehasi/groovy-dc/issues/3): write readme
- [x] Upgrade libraries
- [ ] Rewrite tests with AssertJ
- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Tune Travis CI
- [ ] Update decompilator for the new version of Groovy

Then it would be possible to refactor the code.
